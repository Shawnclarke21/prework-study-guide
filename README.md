## Description

this project is a webpage for me a to place my notes in throughout the bootcamp and a start to my coding journey. the reason i created this webpage was to get a start in coding and see what i will be facing in the future and to also show me how to handle obsticles if and when they show up. the problem that this project solves is note taking. usually when im doing schooling i dont really have a place to take and keep notes because i never have done it before in the past and now i have built my own website to store my notes along with learning coding while doing so. during this porject i learned some basics of Git,HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.
